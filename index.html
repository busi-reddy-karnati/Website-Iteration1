								<h2>Busi Reddy</h2>
								<p>I am an Undergrad Student, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in Computer Networks, especially in Internet of Things, and Mobile AdHoc Networks. I am in awe with what impact technology can have on the lives of people and always curious in finding solutions to real world problems that the technology has to offer. Software development has been a part of the journey and in that, I got to learn about agile development and strategies for good requirement gathering making it easy for the developer.</p>

					<ul class="resume-list">
						<li>
							<h2>2017-Present</h2>
							<h3>Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati</h3>
							<h4>Department Undergraduate Programme Committee<br>Computer Science and Engineering</h4>
							<p>As a member, I have always strived to take the department forward by constantly interacting with the students and putting forward their views in development of the department. The cirriculum for all the semesters have proved to be useful because of the efforts the Committee has put in. The department has been very supportive in bringing in changes that can have a positive impact on the student fraternity.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>May - July 2019</h2>
							<h3>Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada</h3>
							<h4>Research Intern</h4>
							<p>As a research intern, I feel humbled to work under the guidance Dr. Babak Esfandiari, Carleton University and Dr. Thomas Kunz, Carleton University on the problem "Hierarchical Routing Algorithm for the Mobile Adhoc Networks". Different existing solutions to routing in the hierarchical setup, like the flooding and DHT Based solution were analysed and the metrics provided by the Omnet++ simulator served as the base for the development of novel algorithm. The solution was derived part from the Optimized Link State Algorithm(OLSR). I gained hands on experience working with the Omnet++ simulator.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>2017-2019</h2>
							<h3>ECELL, Indian Institute of Information Technology Guwahati</h3>
							<h4>Head for Corporate, Alumni and Startup Affairs.</h4>
							<p>Working at Entrepreneurship Cell has given me opportunities to work closely with Startups around the country and inculcating the same enthusiasm among the students of the institute. The cell has been supportive of Startups coming out of the institute and has given a helping hand in such situtations. I got to learn from the leading startup founders across the country some of whom have been part of Forbes 30 under 30. The leadership role has also given opportunities to organize the team in putting together the Alumni Network providing the students a platform to interact with the people in the industry and also grab the opportunities different fields offer.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2> May - June 2018</h2>
							<h3>Techtrunk.in</h3>
							<h4>Intern, Internet of Things</h4>
							<p>Being in the internship, I have learnt to develop technologies and deploy them for real world use, using Internet of Things. The development has been basically using Raspberry Pi. The factors of scalabilty and reliablity have been the core values guiding through the developement and working in team to build a product was a learning experience. Also tried different Cloud Technologies to analyse and store the data that was produced by the devices deployed. </p>

						<li>
							<h2>2016 - </h2>
							<h3>Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate</h3>
							<h4>Indian Institute of Information Technology, Guwahati</h4>
							<p>My fascination to technolgy has grown in the years I have been in the institute. The institute has provided me with ample opportunities to improve myself and also the teaching in the institute is phenomenal. I like the way the details of the wonderful science of computers unravel themselves to full glory in the classes subsequently that came. I remember till day the first class I sat in, which was Introduction to Computer Programming. I was staring at the blackboard which said "#include<stdio.h>" and I thought It was some remnent of some Greek class before my class. Now I am glad to have done some wonderful projects and involved myself well. I write code now! </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>2008 - 2015</h2>
							<h3>Secondary, Higher Secondary</h3>
							<h4>Sainik School Korukonda, Vizianagaram</h4>
							<p>Being a school under the Ministry of Defence, discipline was the first quality that is imbibed into the students. I have always been encouraged to be curious and passionate about what I did. Being a member of the Football team, I have learnt to work with teams and lead them. I was awarded "Commander T.De Almeida trophy for Courage and Valor " for the year 2015 for my performance in different aspects of my student life. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>2003 - 2008</h2>
							<h3>Primary School</h3>
							<h4>Prathibha English Medium School, Kalluru</h4>
							<p>I feel indebted to the school that turned me into a better one. From being a boy always mischevios, growing up on farm, the teachers had a very tough time teaching, but I am sure they have done it wonderfully well. More than academics, I was taught to be kind to fellow human being and the qualities that are important in the longer run of the race called life. </p>
